# TH OWL Toolbox

The TH OWL GitHub repository provides a comprehensive toolbox developed by students, specifically designed for interacting with the RFEM API. This repository includes numerous useful functions and modules that significantly facilitate the workflow with the RFEM API.

One feature of the repository is its export setup, which allows exporting the finite element mesh as a matrix to Matlab. This function enables seamless integration and further processing of data in Matlab, which is particularly useful for advanced analysis and calculations.

Additionally, the repository offers a variety of example projects that can serve as references or starting points for your own projects. These examples illustrate different use cases and applications of the toolbox, making it easier to get started and understand its capabilities.

The TH OWL GitHub repository is designed as a living project that is continuously developed and expanded. Students and other interested parties are invited to contribute to its development and enrich the project through their own contributions. The goal is to create a comprehensive and versatile resource that can be used and further developed in the long term.

## Structure of the Toolbox

The repository comprises three main folders: Docs, Examples, and SRC.

- **Docs**: Contains documentation for the various programs included in the repository, primarily detailed guides and descriptions.

- **Examples**: Includes a collection of application examples that demonstrate the use of the RFEM API. These examples serve as practical references to help users become familiar with the functions and capabilities of the API. They showcase different application scenarios and provide a good introduction to programming with the RFEM API.

- **SRC**: Houses supplementary functionality for the RFEM API. Here you'll find additional modules and scripts that extend the API and enhance its capabilities. An example of this supplementary functionality is the RFEM-Matlab export setup, which optimizes data exchange and collaboration between the two programs. This folder is particularly useful for developers looking to create customized solutions or extensions for specific requirements.

## Using the Toolbox

To effectively use the toolbox, it is recommended to first create a GitHub account. This will allow you to access the toolbox repository. Once the account is created, you can clone the repository to your computer. This gives you the ability to browse, modify, and further develop the files as needed. With the repository available locally on your computer, you can start editing and customizing it to meet your specific needs. This way, you can fully leverage the benefits of the toolbox and tailor it optimally to your requirements. Make sure to adhere to Git best practices.

## RFEM-Matlab Export Setup

The RFEM-Matlab export setup is structured similarly to a library that provides various functions. After successful integration with PIP (Package Installer for Python), it can now be distributed.

### The Core Class: RFEMDataHandler

A central component of this library is the RFEMDataHandler class. This class is specifically designed to extract information about FE meshes from RFEM. It supports reading information about 1D, 2D, and 3D FE meshes equally.

RFEMDataHandler offers extensive capabilities for analyzing and processing FE mesh data from RFEM. It allows detailed information to be extracted and used for advanced calculations or analyses.
